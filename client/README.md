## How you overcame challenges during this workshop?
  - My biggest challenge was understanding the task at hand. I felt like I kept misunderstanding what was being asked and mistook the tables as the same thing. Once I understood what the tables were doing in the database, I then felt some type of clarity. I am now struggling with rendering everything on the page. 
## Industry interests or reflections you have after working more with the back end 
  - I realized that both front and backend are very tedious. I kind of love and hate how powerful the backend is because it can and will affect the front end if nothing goes according to plan.
